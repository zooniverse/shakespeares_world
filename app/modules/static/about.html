        <h1>About Shakespeare’s World</h1>

        <p>Shakespeare’s World is a collaboration between the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., Zooniverse.org at Oxford University, and the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> of Oxford University Press. In this project we’re inviting you to transcribe manuscripts created by thousands of men and women in and around Shakespeare’s lifetime, 1564–1616.</p>

        <p>2016 marks the 400th anniversary of his death, and it’s an opportune time to broaden our understanding of the period in which he and his contemporaries lived. What was it like to live, work, or raise a family in early modern England? What did people eat, what did they wear, and what issues worried them? What were the hot topics of gossip? What did they do for fun? What did they read and how did they travel? Find out all of this and more by transcribing letters, ‘receipt’ (recipe) books, miscellanies, family papers, legal and literary documents. Whatever your interest, there is something here for you!</p>

        <p>As you transcribe you may come across words and word variants that have not yet been recorded in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. New word and variant candidates are detected while you transcribe. The list of possible candidates will be assessed by the <i>OED</i> team to update the dictionary, and ultimately enrich this important record of the English language.</p>
